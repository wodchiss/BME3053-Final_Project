# BME3053-Final_Project

Our topic for this project is cell detection where we aim to develop an automated solution for detecting and counting cell nuclei in microscopy images. Accurately counting cells is useful in drug development and cancer diagnosis as well as many other applications. However, manual cell counting is incredibly inefficient and risks human error. To address this, we will use the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset, which is linked below, that will help us create a cell nucleus detection model. We will also utilize two Github repositories linked below to train our model. We are currently looking into the use of U-Net (first Github link) as a way towards image segmentation that would help up isolate and identify cell nuclei. This is a deep learning model that would automatically identify cell nuclei. The second Github link provides valuable datasets as well as alternate methods of cell detection. All of these resources combined will allow us to train our model on a variety of images with varying cell types. By automating the cell counting process, our solution will improve efficiency, reduce human error, and improve accuracy.
